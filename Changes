    Correct __rata_die_to_year_day(). Also test it more exhaustively
    (if author) or at least in a more targeted manner (if not).

    Also correct GREGORIAN_RATA_DIE_TO_SHIRE, using a better-thought-out
    computation.

    Remove Shire-related constant from __year_day_to_rata_die() and
    __rata_die_to_year_day(). This way they can be used on any calendar
    having the Gregorian year-length rules.

    Added exportable manifest constant GREGORIAN_RATA_DIE_TO_SHIRE to
    convert from "true" (Gregorian-based) Rata Die to Shire Rata Die.

    Have subroutines return 0 or '' as appropriate (meaning, for legal
    dates to which they do not apply, e.g.  month-related stuff on a
    holiday).

    Simplify __format conversion code. This mostly means things like %m on a
    holiday producing '00', though it also means requiring a day_of_week()
    method on the object passed in. This method was added to the hash
    wrapper, implemented by constructing a {day_of_week} entry if one did
    not already exist.
