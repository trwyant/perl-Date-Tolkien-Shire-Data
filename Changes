    Have subroutines return 0 or '' as appropriate (meaning, for legal
    dates to which they do not apply, e.g.  month-related stuff on a
    holiday).

    Simplify __format conversion code. This mostly means things like %m on a
    holiday producing '00', though it also means requiring a day_of_week()
    method on the object passed in. This method was added to the hash
    wrapper, implemented by constructing a {day_of_week} entry if one did
    not already exist.
